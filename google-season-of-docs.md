# Mattermost participates in the inaugural Google Season of Docs 

In 2019, Mattermost applied to be one of the open source projects to participate in the 
inaugural [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). 

The aim of the program is to engage technical writers with open source communities and contribute to their documentation. 
Our goal with the GSoD program was to highlight Mattermost’s commitment to open source and that we don’t only accept code 
contributions. The program was open to technical writers around the world, and [Mattermost was one of 50 projects out 
of nearly 200 that was selected](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2019/participants). 

We are always looking for opportunities to grow our communities, and involve contributors with a range of skills, including 
writing and editing our technical documentation. Our community of documentation contributors have helped us update, edit, and 
create new documentation, help text, training and other materials to help the community get the most out of Mattermost software.

Our community is an integral part of our product and our business. We work with amazing and ambitious individuals across 
the globe who have varying backgrounds and skill levels.  Whether contributing code, translations, or text, our process 
includes providing upfront guidance to ensure individuals feel confident in starting a project with Mattermost as well 
as working with them through the project and pulling in design, business, or technical resources as needed to help them 
improve their work or encourage their contribution by getting feedback early and often. 

The writer we worked with on the 2019 Google Season of Docs project was Anindita Basu and the project was refining 
the in-product help text. This was a huge undertaking and required a great deal of planning, organization, and focus. 
Anindita worked closely with our Product Management team and at the end of the program we were delighted with the progress 
that wasmade. 

The remaining parts of the project benefit from Anindita’s thorough planning, detailed notes, and willingness to 
contribute outside of the GSoD program - which we’re really excited about. You can read more about Anindita’s 
experience [here](https://github.com/AninditaBasu/AninditaBasu.github.io/wiki/%5BGSoD'19%5D-Mattermost:-Review-and-refine-in-product-text). 

We’re really pleased with the outcome of the program but we don’t want it to end there. We value the impact that 
documentation has on supporting our customers and enabling success. 

Contributing to documentation isn’t limited to professional writers. Often, developers have a unique insight into 
how things work and improve the documentation based on their previous experience. Documentation is also a good way 
to get to know Mattermost if you’re interested in contributing but aren’t sure where to start as it often allows a 
deep dive into a problem which incorporates many facets of Mattermost, and can be as much of a learning experience as 
contributing to our codebase.

[Help Wanted tickets](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADocs%2FNeeded). 
You won’t be working alone - our Product and Technical Writing teams work with you to ensure the process is rewarding. We have 
a style guide to help you get started, and documented processes for each step of the way. And at the end of the day, you 
get to be part of a huge, successful open source project that enables organizations around the world to communicate 
safely and effectively.
